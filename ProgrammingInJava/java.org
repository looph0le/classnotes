* Introduction
** History of java
Java was conceived by James Gosling, Patrick Naughton, Chris Warth, Ed Frank and Mike Sheriden at sun microsystems, Inc. In 1991.
This language was initially called "/Oak/", but latter renamed to "/Java/" in 1995. The orignal impetus for java was not the internet. Instead, to be used for consumer electronic devices, such as microwave, ovens and remote controls.
