#+TITLE: Life Cycle Of thread 

* Mulltithreaded Programming
A multithreaded program contains two or more parts that can run concurrently. Each part of such a program is called a *Thread*., and each thread defines a separate path of execution.
Thus, multithreading is a specialized form of multitasking.
** Process-based
Multitasking is the feature that allows your computer to run two or more programs concurrently.
** Thread-based
In a thread-based multitasking environment, the thread is the smallest unit of dispatchable code.
This means that a single program can perform two or more tasks simultaneously.
