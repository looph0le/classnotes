<h2 id="orgac4040f"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> The file</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
The <b>file</b> is a container for storing information. As a first approximation, we can treat it simply as a sequence of characters. If you name a file foo and write three characters a,b and c into it, then foo will contain only the string abc and nothing else. Unlike the old DOS files, a UNIX file doesn't contain the eof(end-of-line)mark. A file's size is not stored in the file, nor even its name. All file attributes are kept in a separate area of the hard disk, not directly accessible to humans, but only to the kernel.
</p>


<p>
UNIX treats directories and devices as files as well. A directory is simply a folder where you store filenames and other directories. All physical devices like the hard disk, memory, CD-ROM, printer and modem are treated as files.
The shell is also a file, and so is the kernel.
</p>


<p>
We have devided files into three categories:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Ordinary file</b> Also known as regular file. It contains only data as a stream of characters.</li>
<li><b>Directory file</b> It commonly said that a directory contains files and other directories, but strictly speacking, it contains their names and number associated with each name.</li>
<li><b>Device file</b> All devices and peripherals are represented by files. To read and write a device, you have to perform theres operations on its associated file.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4c73840" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org4c73840"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Ordinary File</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
An ordinary file or regular file is the most common file type. All programs you write belong to this type. An ordinary file itself can be divided into two types:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Text file</li>
<li>Binary file</li>
</ul>
<p>
A text file contains only printable characters, shell and perl scripts are text files. A text file contains lines of characters where every line is terminated with the newline character, also known as <i>linefeed(LF)</i>.
</p>


<p>
A binary file, on the other hand, contains both printable and unprintable characters that cover the entire ASCII range (0 to 255). Most UNIX commands are binary files, and the object code and executable that you produce by compiling C programs are also binary files. Pictire, sound and video files are binary files as well. Displaying such files with a simple cat command produces unreadable output and may even disturb your terminal's settings.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgcbd0a4a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgcbd0a4a"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Directory File</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
A directory contains no data, but keeps some details of the files and subdirectories that it contains. The UNIX file system is organized with a number of directories and subdirectories, and you can also create them as and when you need. You often need to do that to group as set of files pertaining to a specific application. This allows two or more files in separate directories to have the same filename.
</p>


<p>
A directory file contains an entry for every file and subdirectory that is houses. If you have 20 files in a directory, there will be 20 entries in the directory. Each entry as two components:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The filename</li>
<li>A unique identification number for the file or directory(called the <i>inode</i> number.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
A directory contains the filename and not the file's contents.
</p>

<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> The name of a file can only be found in its directory; the file itself doesn't contains its own name or any of its attributes, like its size or access rights.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org786a236" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org786a236"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Device File</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Device filenames are generally found inside a single directory structure, /dev. A device file is indeed special; it's not really a stream of characters. In fact, it doesn't contain anything at all. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgcc4cf12" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgcc4cf12"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Whats in a filename?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
A filename can consists of up to 255 characters, Files may or may not have extensions, and can consist of practically any ASCII character execpt the / and the NULL character (ASCII value 0).
It is recommended that only the following characters be used in filename:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Alphabetic characters and numerals.</li>
<li>The period (.), hyphen (-) and underscore (_).</li>
</ul>


<p>
A shell script doesn't need to have the .sh extension, even though it helps in identification.
</p>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A file can have as many dots embedded in its name; a.b.c.d.e is a perfectly valid filename. A filename can also begin with a dot or end with one.</li>
<li>UNIX is sensitive to case; Chap01 and CHAP01 are two different filenames, and it's possible for them to coexist in the same directory.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc8745f2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgc8745f2"><span class="section-number-2">6</span> The parent-clid relationship</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
The file system in UNIX is a collection of all of these related files(ordinary, directory and device files) organized in a hierarchical (an inverted tree) structure.
The implecit feature of every UNIX file system is that there is a top, which serves as the reference point for all files. This top is called root and is represented by a / (frontslash). root is actually a directory.
It is conceptually different from the user-id root used by the system administrator to log in.
</p>


<p>
The root directory(/) has a number of subdirectories under it. These subdirectories in turn have more subdirectories and other files under them. For instance, bin and usr are two directories directly under /, while a second bin and kumar are subdirectories under usr.
</p>


<p>
Every file, apart from root, must have a parent. Thus, the home directory is the parent of kumar, while / is the parent of home, and the grandparent of kumar. If you create a file login.sql under the kumar directory, then kumar will be the parent of the file.
</p>


<p>
It's also obvious that, im these parent-clid relationship, the parent is always a directory. home and kumar are both directories as they are both parents of at least one file or directory. login.sql is simply an ordinary file; it can't have any directory under it.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge4ab680" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge4ab680"><span class="section-number-2">7</span> The HOME variable: The HOME Directory</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<p>
When you log on to the system, UNIX automatically places you in a directory called the <b>home directory</b>. It is created by the system when a user account is opened. If you log in using the login name kumar, you'll land up in a directory that could have the pathname /home/kumar.
</p>

<p>
An <b>absolute pathname</b> shows a file's location with reference to the top, i.e, root. These slashes act as delimiters to file and directory names, except that the first slash is a synonym for root. The directory kumar is placed two levels below root.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga01158f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga01158f"><span class="section-number-2">8</span> pwd: checking your current directory</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">
<p>
A user is placed in a specific directory of the file system on logging in. You can move around from one directory to another, but at any point of time, you are located in only one directory. This directory is known as your <b>current directory</b>.
At any time, you should be able to know what your current directory is. The pwd (print working directory) command tells you that:
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2f0bed9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org2f0bed9"><span class="section-number-2">9</span> cd: changing the current directory</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-9">
<p>
You can move around in the file system by using the cd (change directory command). When used with an argument, it changes the current directory to the directory specified as arguments. Though pwd displays the absolute pathname, cd doesn't need to use one. The command <b>cd progs</b> here means this:"Changing your subdirectory to progs under the current directory" using a pathname causes no harm either; use cd /home/kumar/progs for the same effect.
</p>


<p>
When you need to switch to the /bin directory where most of the commonly used UNIX commnands are kept, you should use absoulte pathname:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">pwd
/home/kumar/progs
cd /bin
pwd
/bin
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This command invoked without an argument doesn't indicate the current directory. It simply switches to the home directory,i.e., the directory where the user originally logged into. Therefore, if you wander around in the file system, you can force an immediate return to your home directory by simply using cd:
</p>


<p>
The cd command can sometimes fail if you don't have proper permissions to access the directory. This doesn't normally happen unless you deliberately tamper with the permissions of the directory.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga68079c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga68079c"><span class="section-number-2">10</span> mkdir: Making Directory</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-10">
<p>
Directories are created with the mkdir(make directory) command. The command is followed by names of the directories to be created. A directory <i>patch</i> is created under the current directory like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">$ mkdir patch
</pre>
</div>

<p>
you can create a number of subdirectories with one mkdir command:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">$ mkdir patch dbs doc
</pre>
</div>


<p>
UNIX system goes further and lets you create directory trees with just one invocation of the command.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">$ mkdir pis pis/progs pis/data
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This creates three subdirectories-pis and two subdirectories under pis. The order of specifying the arguments is important; you obviously can't create a subdirectory before creating of its parent directory.
</p>


<p>
Sometimes, the system refuses to create a directory:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">$ mkdir test
mkdir: Failed to make directory "test"; permission denied
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This happens due to these reasons:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The directory test may already exist.</li>
<li>There may be an ordinary file by the name in the current directory.</li>
<li>The permissions set for the current directory don't permit the creation of files and directories by the user. You'll most certainly get this messages if you try to create a directory in /bin, /etc or any other directory that houses the UNIX system's files.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga9c85c3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga9c85c3"><span class="section-number-2">11</span> rmdir: Removing Directories</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-11">
<p>
The rmdir(remove directory) command removes directories. You simply have to do this to remove the directory pis:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">$ rmdir pis
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Like mkdir, rmdir can also delete more than one directories in one shot. For instance, the three directories and subdirectories that were just created with mkdir can be removed by using rmdir with a reversed set of arguments:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">$ rmdir pis/data pis/progs pis
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Note that when you delete a directory and its subdirectories, a reverse logic has to be applied. The following directory sequence used by mkdir is invalid in rmdir:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">$ rmdir pis pis/progs pis/data
rmdir: directory "pis": Directory not empty
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Have you observed one thing from the error message? <b>rmdir</b> has silently deleted the lowest level subdirectories progs and data. This error message leads to two important rules that you should remember when deleting directories:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You can't delete a directory with rmdir unless it is empty. In this case, the pis directory couldn't be removed because of the existence of the subdirectories, progs and data, under it.</li>
<li>You can't remove a subdirectory unless you are placed in a directory which is hierarchically above the one you have chosen to remove.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To remove this directory you must position yourself in the directory above progs,i.e.,pis, and then remove it from there:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">$ cd /home/kumar/pis
$ pwd
/home/kumar/pis
$ rmdir progs
</pre>

<p>
The mkdir and rmdir commands work only in directories owned by the user. Generally, a user is the owner of her home directory, and she can create and remove subdirectories(as well as regular files) in this directory or in any subdirectories created by her.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-12">
<p>
As stated before, if the first character of a pathname is /, the file's location must be determined with respect to root(the first /). Such a pathname, is called an <b>absolute pathname</b>.
</p>

<p>
When you specify a file by using frontslash to democrate the various levels, you have a mechanism of identifying a file uniquely. No two files in a UNIX system can have identical absoulte pathnames. You can have two files with same name, but in different directories; their pathnames will also be different. Thus, the file /home/kumar/progs/c2f.pl can coexist with the file /home/kumar/safe/c2f.pl.

<h2 id="orge8125c5"><span class="section-number-2">13</span> Using The Absoulte Pathname For a Command</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-13">
<p>
More often then not, a UNIX command runs by executing its disk file. When you specify the <b>date</b> command, the system has to locate the file date from a list of directories specified in the PATH variable, and then execute it.
However, if you know the location of a particular command, you can precede its name with the complete path. Since <b>date</b> in /bin(or /usr/bin), you can alos use the absolute pathname:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">$ /bin/date
Thu Sep 1 09:30:49 IST 2005
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Nobody runs the <b>date</b> command like that. For any command that resides in the directories specified in the PATH variable, you don't need to use the absoulte pathname. This PATH, invariably has the directories /bin and /usr/bin in its list.
</p>


<p>
If you execute programs residing in some other directory that isn't in PATH, the absoulte pathname then needs to be specified. For example, to execute the program <b>less</b> residing in /usr/local/bin, need to enter the absoulte pathname:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">/usr/local/bin/less
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If you are frequently accessing programs in a certain directory, it's better to include the directory itself in PATH.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-14">
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">cd progs/scripts
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Here we have a pathname that has a /, but it is not an absoulte pathname because it doesn't begin with a /. In this example, we used a rudimentary form of relative pathnames though they are generally not labeled as such. Relative pathnames, in the sense they are known.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org8d5a965" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org8d5a965"><span class="section-number-2">15</span> Using . And .. In Relative Pathnames</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-15">
<p>
In a preceding example, you changed your directory from /home/kumar/pis/progs to its parent directory (/home/kumar/pis) by using <b>cd</b> with an absoulte pathname:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">cd /home/kumar/pis
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Navigation often becomes easier by using a common ancestor (here, /home) as reference. UNIX offers a shotcut-the <b>relative pathname</b>- that uses either the current or parent directory as reference, and specifies the path relative to it. A relative pathname uses one of these cryptic symbols:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>. (a single dot) This represents the current directory.</li>
<li>.. (two dots) This represents the parent directory.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We'll now use the .. to frame relative pathnames. Assuming that you are placed in /home/kumar/progs/data/text, you can use .. as an argument to <b>cd</b> to move to the parent directory, /home/kumar/progs/data:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">$ pwd
/home/kumar/progs/data/text
$ cd ..
$ pwd
/home/kumar/progs/data
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This method is compact and more useful when ascending the heirarchy. The command <b>cd ..</b> translates to: "Change your directory to the parent of the current directory."
You can combine any such sets of .. separated by /s. However, when a / is used with .. it acquired a different meaning; instead of moving down a level, it moves one level up. For instance, to move to /home, you can always use <b>cd /home</b>. Alternatively, you can also use a relative pathname:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">$ pwd
/home/kumar/pis
$ cd ../..
$ pwd
/home
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now let's turn to the solitary dot that refers to the current directory. Any command which uses the current directory as argument can also work with a single dot. this means that the <b>cp</b> command which also uses a directory as the last argument can be used with a dot:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">cp ../sharma/.profile .
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This copies the file .profile to the current directory (.). Note that you didn't have to specify the filename of the copy; it's the same as the original one. Thos dot is also implicitly included whenever we use a filename as arguments, rather than a pathname. For instance, <b>cd progs</b> is the same as <b>cd ./progs</b>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org8f1bdeb" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org8f1bdeb"><span class="section-number-2">16</span> ls: Listing Directory Contents</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-16">
<p>
You have already used the <b>ls</b> command to obtain a list of all filenames in the current directory.
</p>


<p>
What you see after executing is a complete list of filenames in the current directory arranged in <b>ASCII collation sequence</b> (numbers first, uppercase and then lowecase), with one filename is each line. It includes directories also.
</p>


<p>
Directories often contain many files, and you may simply be intrested in only knowing whether a particular file is available. In this case, just use <b>ls</b> with the filename:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">$ ls calendar
calendar
</pre>
</div>

<p>
and if <b>perl</b> isn't available, the system clearly says so:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">$ ls perl
perl: No such file or directory
</pre>
</div>

<p>
<b>ls</b> can also be used with multiple filenames, and has options that list most of the file attributes. In the following sections, you'll see some of these options.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgecfbff4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgecfbff4"><span class="section-number-2">17</span> ls Options</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-17">
<p>
<b>ls</b> has a large number of options, but in this section, we'll present a handful of them. The other options will be taken up in later.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Output in Multiple Columns (-x)</i> When you have several files, its better to display the filenames in multiple columns. Modern versions of <b>ls</b> do that by default.</li>
<li><i>Identify Directories and Executables (-F)</i> The output of <b>ls</b> that you have seen so far merely showed the filenames. You didn't know how many of them, if any, were directory files. To identify directories and executable files, the -F option should be used.</li>
<li><i>Showing Hidden Files Also (-a)</i> <b>ls</b> doesn't normally show all files in a directory. There are certain hidden files (filenames beginning with a dot), often found in the home directory, that nomrally don't show up in the listing. The -a option (all) lists all hidden files as well.</li>
<li><p>
<i>Listing Directory Contents</i> In this last example, you specified some ordinary filenames to <b>ls</b> to have selective listing. However, the situation will be quite different if you specify the two directory names, helpdir and progs, instead.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">  $ ls -x helpdir progs
     helpdir:
     forms.obd grapfics.obd reports.obd

     progs:
arrays.pl cent2fah.pl n2words.pl name.pl
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This time the contents of the directory are listed, consisting of the Oracle documentation in the helpdir directory and a number of <b>perl</b> program files in progs.
</p></li>
<li><i>Recursive Listing(-R)</i> The -R (recursive) option lists all files and sundirectories in a directory tree, this traversal of the directory is done recursively until there are no subdirectories left.</li>

<h2 id="org68063b0"><span class="section-number-2">18</span> The UNIX File System</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-18">
<p>
We have learned to use the basic command set for handling files and directories. Let's conclude this chapter by taking a cursory look at the structure of the UNIX file system. This structure has been changing constantly over the years until AT&amp;T proposed one in its SVR4 release.
</p>


<p>
In real life, the root directory has many more subdirectories under it than shown, but for our initial comprehension, we'll stick to the ones presented below.
</p>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>/bin and /usr/bin &#x2013; These are the directories where all the commonly used UNIX commands (binaries, hence the name bin) are found. Note that the PATH variable always shows these directories in its list.</li>
<li>/sbin and /usr/sbin &#x2013; If there's a command that you can't execute but the system administrator can, then it would probably be in one of these directories. You won't be able to execute most (some, you can) commands in these directories. Only the system administrator's PATH shows these directories.</li>
<li>/etc &#x2013; This directory contains the configuartion files of the system. You can change a very important aspect of system functioning by editing a text file in this directory. Your login name and password are stored in files /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow.</li>
<li>/dev &#x2013; This directory contains all device files. These files don't occupy space on disk. These could be more subdirectories like pts,dsk and rdsk in this directory.</li>
<li>/lib and /usr/lib &#x2013; contains all library files in binary form. You'll need to link your C programs with files in these directories.</li>
<li>/usr/include &#x2013; Contains the standard header files used by C programs. The statement #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; used in most C programs refers to the file stdio.h in this directory.</li>
<li>/usr/share/man &#x2013; This is where the man pages are stored. These are separate subdirectories here (like man1, man2, etc.) that contains the pages from each section.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Overtime, the contents of these directories would change as more software and utilities are added to the system. Users also work with their own files;they write programs, send and receive mail and also create temporary files. These files are available in the second group shown below:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>/tmp &#x2013; The directory where users are allowed to create temporary files. These files are wiped away regularly by the system.</li>
<li>/var &#x2013; The variable part of the file system. Contains all your print jobs and your outgoing and incoming mail.</li>
<li>/home &#x2013; On many systems users are housed here. Kumar would have his home directory in /home/kumar. However, your system may use a different location for home directories.</li>
</ul>
