#+TITLE: Handling Ordinary Files



* cat: Displaying and Creating Files
cat is one of the most well-known commands in the UNIX system. It is mainly used to display the contents of a small file on the terminal.


cat, like several other UNIX commands, also accepts more than one filename as arguments.


The contents of the second file are shown immediately after the first file without any header information. In other words, cat concatinates the two files--hence its name.

** cat Options (-v and -n)
There are two cat options that you may find useful, though POSIX doesn't require cat to support either one.

- Displaying Nonprinting Characters(-v)
